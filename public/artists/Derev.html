                <p>Derev is a progressive Rock/Metal band from Toronto, Canada, formed by the Italian/Armenian guitarist
                    Armando Bablanian and the Syrian/Armenian drummer Michel Karakach. Derev’s sound combines the energy
                    and intensity of metal music with the atmospheric sound of old-school progressive rock, while
                    incorporating elements of their Arabic and Armenian heritage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plan for what eventually became Derev was in the works since Michel and Armando met in high
                    school while living in Kuwait. At the time, they were unable to pursue the project due to
                    circumstances of living in the Middle East.

                </p>
                <p>
                    After obtaining his dental degree in Syria & immigrating to Canada, Michel joined Armando in Toronto
                    to form the band after an eight-year hiatus, where they met the bassist Liam Horrigan who recently
                    joined the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Derev released their 6-track debut EP (Leap of Faith) on May 21, 2021. The band has also released
                    two music videos; one for their latest single “Turab”, and an animated video for “Futile”.

                    Armando (guitarist/songwriter), an engineering graduate from the University of Toronto, has been an
                    active musician for over 10 years. His most notable work is with the Canadian metal band “Till I
                    Conquer” with whom he released an EP and 3 singles.

                    Michel (drummer/songwriter) has been an active drummer for the past 10 years. He was constantly
                    organizing and playing shows while obtaining his dental degree in Syria. Fortunately for him, he had
                    the opportunity to immigrate to Canada and pursue his musical career with Armando to bring Derev to
                    life.

                    Liam (bassist) who’s also an engineering graduate from the University of Toronto, started his
                    musical career with Ottawa-based act "Open Season". He has diversified across instruments, genres,
                    and locations (including performances throughout southern Ontario and the release of an alternative
                    rock solo EP as @t_ii_f).
