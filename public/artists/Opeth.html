                <p>Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal/rock band from Stockholm, formed in 1989.[2][3] The group has
                    been through several personnel changes, including the replacement of every single original member.
                    Lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force
                    since the departure of original vocalist David Isberg in 1992. Opeth has consistently incorporated
                    progressive, folk, blues, classical, and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as
                    well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include
                    acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as death growls. Opeth is also well
                    known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. The band rarely made live appearances
                    supporting their first four albums, but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001
                    release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.

                    Opeth has released 13 studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction
                    with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995. Although their eighth
                    studio album, Ghost Reveries, was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major
                    American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, Watershed, which
                    peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of
                    release. As of November 2009, the band has sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs
                    worldwide,[4] including 300,000 collective SoundScans of their albums Blackwater Park, Damnation,
                    and Deliverance in the United States.
