                <p>Electronic dance music (EDM), also known as dance music, club music, or simply dance, is a broad
                    range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. It is
                    generally produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by
                    segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or
                    festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA.
                    In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radios, PartyCrews,
                    underground festivals and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved widespread mainstream
                    popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not
                    universal outside of New York City; although both electro and Chicago house music were influential
                    both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained
                    openly hostile to it. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture, which led
                    governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave
                    culture. Fitness classes were first to use the music for work out classes in which help bring it to
                    the mainstream and out of only underground events and clubs.
