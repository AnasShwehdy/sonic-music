                <h2 style="padding-top: 20px">Indie rock</h2>
                <p>CouIndie rock is a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and United Kingdom in the
                    1970s. Originally used to describe independent record labels, the term became associated with the
                    music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock or "guitar pop
                    rock".[1] In the 1980s, the use of the term "indie" (or "indie pop") started to shift from its
                    reference to recording companies to describe the style of music produced on punk and post-punk
                    labels.[2] During the 1990s, grunge and punk revival bands in the US and Britpop bands in the UK
                    broke into the mainstream, and the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning.
                    The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their
                    independent status.[3] By the end of the 1990s, indie rock developed several subgenres and related
                    styles, including lo-fi, noise pop, emo, slowcore, post-rock, and math rock.[3] In the 2000s,
                    changes in the music industry and a growing importance of the internet enabled a new wave of indie
                    rock bands to achieve mainstream success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.
